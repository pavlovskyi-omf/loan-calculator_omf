The goal to prepare initial requirements files for creating an application called "Personal Loan Calculator".

Personal Loan Calculator is a simple web application that helps users estimate monthly loan payments based on the loan amount, APR, and repayment period. It allows users to adjust interest rates with a slider, compare different loan amounts and terms, and instantly see how these changes affect their monthly payments.

I will be using GitHub Copilot and the Context Engineering approach.

Run a Q&A session (suggest possible options for each question) to help clarify and define these elements. Move to Step 2 only after all questions are answered.

## Step 1: Requirements Clarification
Conduct an initial research phase to define:
- Initial requirements
- Technology stack
- Architectural considerations

Use an example UI of a similar application (screenshot is attached to this message). 
Replicate the UI/UX design and idea from this example, all input fields, sliders, and buttons. 
Based on the provided design, also cover some relevant questions during the Q&A.

## Step 2: Implementation Plan Preparation
Once the requirements are clarified, generate the files needed for working with the GitHub Copilot Agent to initialize the implementation plan:
- ARCHITECTURE.md : (max 2 page) file that describes the overall architecture of the project.
- PRODUCT.md : (max 2 page) file that describes the product functionality of the project.
- CONTRIBUTING.md : (max 1 page) file that describes developer guidelines and best practices for contributing to the project.
- custom-instructions.md : file defines persistent, project-specific rules and preferences that guide GitHub Copilot’s behavior, ensuring consistent code style, architecture, and development practices across AI-assisted workflows.
